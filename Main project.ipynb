    "Q1.Why is your proposal important in today’s world? How predicting a disease accurately can improve medical treatment?\n",
    "Predicting disesase accurately using Machine learning. Particularly for COVID-19 hold significant importance in today's world as early detection of such disease on the basis of symptoms can help the healthcare facility to isolate and treat the patient timely this is crucial to prevent the spread of disease\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2.How is it going to impact the medical field when it comes to effective screening and reducing health care burden.\n",
    "Our medical facilities are using test such as RAT (Rapid Antigen Test) to detect whether a person is COVID affected,while our ML model use patient data to detect whether a particular patient is COVID affected or not with almost accuracy this help to reduce the burden of testing and screening on the healthcare facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3.If any, what is the gap in the knowledge or how your proposed method can be helpful if required in future for any other disease.\n",
    "Bad quality of data or missing data can prove to be a problem for a such model but if it works well for COVID-19,We might use a similar approach for other diseases in the future.It is like having a valuable tool for our medical facilities.\n",

    "Initial Hypothesis\n",
    "Prediction hypothesis: Prediction hypothesis with think we can predict COVID-19 by looking at symptoms and some personal info.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefit of accurate prediction: Accurate prediction can speed up treatment, resource use and disease management, reducing the strain on healthcare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common symptoms of hypothesis: COVID-19 often causes coughing, fever and breathing problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncommon symptoms Hypothesis: People without COVID-19 are less likely to have a store sore throat or headache.\n",
    "\n",
    "symptoms Specific group: Men with COVID-19, who have been in contact with people from other countries might have more coughing and fever.\n",
    "\n",
    "Age and severity Hypothesis: Those 60 and older age, might have more severe symptoms, especially trouble getting breathing.\n",
